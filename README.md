# Yelp-data-collection
I implement scripts to collect data from Yelp.com website, including all restaurant information (restaurant Id, name, address, rating, number of reviews, coordinates,...),  restaurant's open hours, and up to three reviews excerpts for a given restaurants in the obtained list.
